== Implementation

This section outlines the steps required to implement the Trello clone project.

=== Phase 1: Setting Up the Environment
1. **Front-End Setup**:
   - Initialize a React project with TypeScript using `create-react-app` or a custom webpack setup.
   - Install TailwindCSS for styling.
   - Set up basic routing and project structure.

2. **Back-End Setup**:
   - Create a new Spring Boot project with WebFlux, PostgreSQL, and OAuth dependencies.
   - Configure PostgreSQL database connection.
   - Implement initial database schema for users, boards, lists, cards, task dependencies, comments, and memberships.
   - Use Liquibase or Flyway for managing database migrations.

3. **AWS Setup**:
   - Set up AWS environment (EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk) for hosting the back-end services.
   - Create RDS (PostgreSQL) instance to host the database.

=== Phase 2: Front-End Completion (UI & Core Features)
1. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - Implement email/password registration and login using JWT on the front-end.
   - Integrate OAuth login (e.g., Google).
   - Store and manage JWT tokens in the client.

2. **Board, List, and Card UI**:
   - Develop the user interface for creating and managing boards, lists, and cards.
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for cards within lists.

3. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Set up WebSocket listeners for real-time updates in the front-end.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for UI components using Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Ensure WebSocket events are correctly processed in the UI.

=== Phase 3: Back-End Development and Testing
1. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for email/password login and OAuth login.
   - Build secure APIs for registration, login, and user management.

2. **Task and Board Management**:
   - Implement RESTful APIs for managing boards, lists, and cards.
   - Add logic for task dependencies, ensuring tasks cannot be marked as "Done" if dependent tasks are not yet completed.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Implement WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates on boards and cards.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests using JUnit 5 for core back-end logic, including authentication, task management, and WebSocket handling.
   - Integration tests to verify API endpoints and WebSocket communication.

=== Phase 4: Deployment and Finalization
1. **Integration**:
   - Connect the front-end with the back-end for seamless operation.
   - Ensure all features (authentication, task management, real-time collaboration) work as expected in both front-end and back-end.

2. **AWS Deployment**:
   - Deploy the front-end to AWS (S3 for static assets).
   - Deploy the back-end to EC2/Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Set up RDS (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage.
   - Secure the AWS infrastructure with proper IAM roles, security groups, and SSL certificates (using AWS ACM).

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment to AWS.
   - Ensure automated testing is part of the pipeline.

=== Phase 5: Final Testing and Launch
1. **QA and Load Testing**:
   - Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure the entire system functions as expected.
   - Perform load testing using AWS CloudWatch to monitor performance under stress.

2. **Production Launch**:
   - Perform the final deployment to the AWS production environment.
   - Set up logging, monitoring, and alerts using AWS CloudWatch and third-party services.
   - Ensure post-launch monitoring and error tracking systems (e.g., Sentry) are in place.
