== Milestones

The following milestones are designed to track the progress of the Trello clone project, ensuring that both the front-end and back-end development, testing, and deployment are completed systematically.

=== Phase 1: Initial Setup and Architecture (1-2 weeks)
* **Deliverables**:
  - Front-end project setup with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
  - Back-end project setup with Spring Boot WebFlux, PostgreSQL configuration, and initial database schema.
  - AWS environment configuration (EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk, RDS for PostgreSQL).

=== Phase 2: Front-End Completion (3-4 weeks)
* **Deliverables**:
  - Implement user authentication (email/password, OAuth) on the front-end.
  - Create and style components for boards, lists, and cards.
  - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for cards.
  - Integrate WebSockets for real-time updates.
  - Customize UI using TailwindCSS.

* **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Test WebSocket integration.

=== Phase 3: Back-End Feature Development and Testing (3-4 weeks)
* **Deliverables**:
  - Implement authentication (email/password and OAuth) with JWT.
  - Develop APIs for managing boards, lists, cards, and task dependencies.
  - Set up WebSockets for real-time collaboration.

* **Testing**:
  - JUnit 5 tests for core back-end functionality.
  - Integration tests for API and WebSocket endpoints.

=== Phase 4: Integration and Deployment (2 weeks)
* **Deliverables**:
  - Connect the front-end to the back-end services.
  - Finalize UI/UX.
  - Deploy to AWS (EC2/Elastic Beanstalk for the back-end, S3 for the front-end).
  - Configure AWS services for security, scalability, and performance (RDS, SSL certificates, etc.).

=== Phase 5: Final Testing and QA (1 week)
* **Deliverables**:
  - Perform end-to-end testing and gather stakeholder feedback.
  - Conduct performance and security testing.
  
=== Phase 6: Production Launch (1 week)
